# Bank Churn Prediction App

## Overview

This Bank Churn Prediction app leverages a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of customer churn for a bank. Churn prediction is critical for businesses to retain their customers by identifying those who are likely to leave. This app utilizes advanced machine learning techniques and a robust neural network to provide accurate churn predictions and insights.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Columns with a high percentage of missing values are removed, and the remaining missing values are imputed using appropriate strategies.
- **Categorical and Numerical Features**: Separate pipelines handle the preprocessing of categorical and numerical features, including scaling and encoding.

### Model Training
- **Deep Learning Network**: A sequential neural network with multiple dense layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers is used to train the model. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
- **SMOTE**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to handle class imbalance in the training data.
- **Callbacks**: Early stopping and learning rate reduction are implemented to enhance the training process.

### Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrices for both training and validation sets.
- **PCA Visualization**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to visualize the variance explained by different components in the dataset.

### Streamlit App Interface
- **Customer Details**: Users can select a customer ID to view detailed information about the selected customer.
- **Churn Prediction**: The app predicts the churn probability for the selected customer, displaying the result in a user-friendly manner.
- **LIME Explanation**: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) are used to explain the model's prediction, providing insights into the features that contributed to the churn prediction.

## Usage

1. **Data Upload**: Load the CSV file containing customer data.
2. **Select Customer**: Choose a customer ID from the dropdown list to view their details.
3. **Predict Churn**: Click the "Predict Churn" button to get the churn probability for the selected customer.
4. **Feature Importance**: View a bar plot explaining the feature importance and contribution to the churn prediction using LIME.
